We start with some fundamentals of Python programming.
This directory contains a series of numbered "scripts" designed as a working exercise
to be followed along in a Python console as part of a workshop presentation.
These files can also be run as python scripts from the command line, e.g. "python fundamentals.py",
although you probably won't get a lot from that.
The prompts and content were inspired by the brilliant codebar organisation's tutorials.
