Python is an object oriented programming language. Pretty much everything in Python is an object.
Classes and objects are fundamental concepts in object oriented programming.
Think of classes as instruction manuals - they describe what an object of that type should look like,
specifying things like properties of the object, and functions that can be called on the object.
An object is an instance of a class. This object may have properties and methods that can be called on it.

Classes and objects are difficult concepts to get your head around, so don't be disheartened if you
don't understand things straight away.
